      <p>Welcome to my course website! This is a course about the big ideas of computer science and why they are important and applicable in the real world. You don't need any programming experience to get started.
        <br>
        <br>
        To get started - check out the Videos tab.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you want to dive into various levels of practice problems, check out the Practice tab.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can find all the code from this course <a href="https://github.com/nipunramk/Introduction-to-Computer-Science-Course" style = "color: blue">here</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Look <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY" style = "color: blue">here</a> for inpiration from President Obama on why you should learn computer science.
        <br>
        <br>        
        If that doesn't convince you to get started, an obligatory motivational video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0" style = "color: blue">here</a>.

      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Overview of the Course</h2>
      <p>This course is taught completely in Python. One big advantage of Python is that not only is it one of the most popular and most used programming languages, but also one of the easiest programming languages to learn. Using Python allows for easy demonstration of some of the most fundamental concepts in computer science. It also has a developer community of many millions of people and is used in several large and respected companies including Google, Intel, Yahoo, NASA, Dropbox, IBM, Netflix, Yelp, and many more. Additionally Python is one of the most popular languages for academic research. 
        <br>
        <br>
        But this course is not just about Python. In fact, Python is really just a medium for learning the concepts in this class, and most of these concepts can be similarly applied to any other programming language. This course will leave you with a strong understanding of basic ideas in computer science, such as expressions, variables, functions, conditional statements, iteration, and abstraction. Additionally, you will also learn about some other advanced ideas such as recursion, managing data, object oriented programming, data structures, efficiency, and much more. After finishing this course, you will not only be able to call yourself a true computer scientist, but you will also have the ability to pick up any programming language in a few days, understand how to instruct a computer to execute particular tasks, and most importantly, understand a topic that is truly changing and affecting all technology in our daily lives.</p>

      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. One of the reasons I decided to do this course was that I actually tried to start programming many times before I reached college, but always failed or felt like I did not really learn anything. It was not until I experienced the Berkeley introductory computer science class - CS61A - before I finally felt like I understood what computer science entailed, and I found that I really enjoyed it. This course is largely based on Berkeley's CS61A, but more of my perspective on it. I included only the parts that I think are truly essential to learning computer science. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Another huge reason I decided to teach this course was I took an amazing class at Berkeley called Introduction to Teaching Computer Science and I came to realize through that course how much I enjoyed not only learning about this subject, but also how much I enjoyed spreading my enthusiasm for the subject to people interested in getting started with computer science.</p>
